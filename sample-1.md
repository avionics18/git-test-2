# Introduction to Git

Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)**, a powerful software tool essential for modern software development and collaborative projects.

**What does that mean?**

-   **Version Control System (VCS):** At its core, Git helps you track changes to your files over time. Think of it like a super-powered "undo" button for your entire project, but much more sophisticated. It allows you to:

    -   See exactly who changed what, and when.
    -   Revert to previous versions of files or the entire project if something goes wrong.
    -   Experiment with new ideas in isolated "branches" without affecting the main stable version of your project.
    -   Understand the history and evolution of your codebase.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
    return <div>App</div>;
};

export default App;
```
